# Overview

The ID3 tag information generated by K3b when using Lame for encoding to mp3 does not
encode strings properly and Amarok will display strange characters when special
chars are present in song titles or artist names.

This utility will fix the ID3 encoding issues in those generated files.

# Installing

    gem install fix-lame-id3-generated-by-k3b

# Usage

    fix-lame-id3-generated-by-k3b "Music/Noel Rosa/*.mp3"
